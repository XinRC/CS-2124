## Exception Handling

</div>

Just like in Python, C++ allows a program to try and catch an error before it can crash the program. The syntax for exception handling is very similar to that of pythons, with a `try` and `catch(condition)` scenario. There can be multiple `catch()` phrases for handling different types of exceptions that might be thrown - like in Python, the order matters. There is also a "catch all" exception catcher that uses the syntax `catch(...).
