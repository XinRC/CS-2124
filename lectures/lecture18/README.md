## Inheritance: Poly / Non-Member, Overloading vs. Overriding

</div>


### Poly / Non-Member

For polymorphism, nonmember functions can also be used. 

### Overloading vs. Overriding

Overriding is when we create a method that will be overridden in it's derived class. Overloading is when the compiler picks the most specific overload based on compile-time arguments. For example, a function can have the same name but different type of parameters thus the compiler during compile time would provide an output based on that.
