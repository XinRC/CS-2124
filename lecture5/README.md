### Nesting Classes
Whilst nesting **publically** You are able to nest classes into other classes, usually they are inside the `public` section. However, if you try to access the innerclass, qualifying it, you must use `[Outside Class]::[Inner Class]`. This means if you ever want to access the inner class, we must use the above command. When nesting **privately**, we are no longer able to acess the inner class from the outside.
