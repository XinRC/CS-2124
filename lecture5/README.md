## Nesting Classes

</div> 

### Nesting Classes
Whilst nesting **publically** You are able to nest classes into other classes, usually they are inside the `public` section. However, if you try to access the innerclass, qualifying it, you must use `[Outside Class]::[Inner Class]`. This means if you ever want to access the inner class, we must use the above command. When nesting **privately**, we are no longer able to access the inner class from the outside.

### Friending Functions
This allows an outside function to access materials from a private area. To use this, we must declare the function as a friend using the keyword `friend`. 

</br> 

### Operation Overloading
When creating a class that has methods, we are able to overload certain operations. Do note there is a more in depth campiagn done in [Lecture 3's](https://github.com/XinRC/CS-2124/blob/main/lecture3/README.md) notes.
